# Policies

Read when declaring callable authentication or authorization, or using a Schema Policy.

## Authentication mode is not the authorization rule

The installed Schema declares each callable's authentication mode and optional callable Policy;
Kernel Runtime defines and evaluates those semantics against the pinned installation state:

- `anonymous` permits an absent credential. If a credential is supplied, Runtime authenticates it and
  propagates authentication failure instead of falling back to anonymous;
- `authenticated` requires an authenticated actor;
- `authorized` requires an authenticated actor. The principal of the active installed Kernel registration
  bypasses the remaining callable gate; every other caller requires effective caller-principal authority
  and complete caller Grant admission described below;
- only `authorized` may declare a callable Policy. `authenticated` does not add a `can_use` or Policy gate.
- Do not recreate these gates inside an Action or Workflow, or use `authenticated` as a shortcut for
  a protected operation merely because its handler can access Domain-owned data.

## Function admission: caller principal AND complete Grant

The caller `principal` is the Identity established by authentication. Its effective Identity profile
and the credential's complete Grant are separate inputs. Do not derive caller authority from the executor.

For a non-Root caller, an authorized Function requires both:

1. The caller's own Identity profile supplies `can_use` or exact Function ownership. Evaluate live
   `extends_with`, `constrained_by`, and `excluded_from` composition with deny-wins: a User may inherit
   `can_use` from a Group without an individual capability Edge. An unrelated capable Identity merely
   carried in the credential cannot supply this principal ceiling.
2. The complete caller Grant passes the intrinsic Root/Function-owner branch OR the declared callable
   Policy. Missing Policy supplies no alternative. `can_use` is no longer an intrinsic Grant bypass;
   giving the caller that capability does not defeat a business Policy.

- The executor never replaces the caller principal. Exact Method ownership follows its executable declaring
  installation, not a business `ownedBy` Edge; instance receivers must have the exact declaring Class.
- Evaluate each alternative over the whole Grant. Identities inside an intersection cannot combine
  intrinsic ownership from one branch with Policy satisfaction from another. A carried Root Identity
  remains inside the Grant branch; only the authenticated installed Kernel Root takes the outer shortcut.
- A Policy `subject` is an evaluated Grant Identity, not necessarily the authenticated principal.
- Protected Kernel syscalls explicitly attach `canUseSyscall` to their exact Function or Method. That
  Policy checks the complete Grant's `can_use`; resource checks inside the syscall remain independent.
  Capability-only callable admission must likewise be declared explicitly, not inferred from `can_use`.

## Graph access is a separate decision

- Invoking `Project.rename` does not grant direct Query/Mutation access to Project nodes. Conversely,
  a permitted graph read is not proof that the caller may invoke a Function operating on that record.
- With a declared Class `read`/`traverse` Policy, observation admission needs no additional principal
  Class capability: the complete Grant passes through capability, ownership, or that Policy. Class
  capability/ownership therefore remains an alternative to observation Policy, unlike Function `can_use`.
- Without an observation Policy, the selected principal must own or hold the exact Class capability
  (or be Kernel Root); the Grant plane is neutral. This does not make data public. The outer Query
  Function gate still applies in both cases. Choose the intended View boundary in `views.md`.
- Current Class effects (`create`/`update`/`delete`) do not evaluate Class observation Policies. For a
  non-Root principal, effect closure requires principal capability/ownership and complete-Grant
  capability/ownership. If initiated through a callable, callable admission remains a separate outer gate.
- Read authority also permits traversal; traversal alone does not permit property reads. Test what
  the caller can observe, not just whether one isolated `traverse` Policy matches.

## Declare the business rule at its owner

- Project convention: give each match Policy a `description` stating the subject, protected object or
  endpoints, and condition, naming the business relation when one exists. Keep reusable graph predicates
  in the module's `policies/`, never `types/`; place a callable's check inline in its declaration.
- `policy.allOf(...)` / `policy.anyOf(...)` currently accept Policy operands, not description options.
  Describe the constituent match Policies; do not add unsupported metadata or duplicate patterns for a label.
- Read `users.md` for Shell User subclasses, registration, and membership. Business graph ownership
  does not justify a shadow User or manual writes to Shell's membership/authority pair.
- Declare the exact protected foreign Function in Application requirements when calling as the Domain,
  including Policy-admitted Shell methods. Installation supplies the Domain principal's capability;
  the carried Grant must still satisfy the callable's intrinsic or Policy branch.
- For a human-principal session, inspect the human's effective group profile instead. Domain requirements
  do not grant that human authority, and a missing direct User capability is not a reason to duplicate
  rights already supplied through `extends_with`.
- `kernel.auth.register(...)` requires `K.functions.register` and must independently satisfy
  its credential, target, and graph/Schema admission. Select the caller/Domain session explicitly; a Schema
  dependency is not a capability, and granting the human rights is not Domain-owned execution.

```ts
import { method, policy } from '@astrale-os/sdk/schema'
import { z } from 'zod'

import { manages } from './relationships.js'

export const mayRenameProject = policy({
  description: 'The caller manages this Project.',
  match: ({ edge, subject, object }) =>
    edge({ source: subject, class: manages, target: object }),
})

export const rename = method({
  auth: 'authorized',
  input: z.object({ title: z.string() }),
  output: z.boolean(),
  policy: ({ check, self }) => check(mayRenameProject, self),
})
```

- Runtime dispatches `Project.rename` as an Action or Workflow. Its context facilities are not a second
  authorization decision; handler code must not replace Kernel admission with a role lookup.

## Reuse without changing what is checked

- Named `policy.allOf(...)` / `policy.anyOf(...)` composition and callable `check(...)` accept only exact local
  named Policy refs; cycles and foreign named Policy refs are rejected. A dependency's presence does not make
  its named Policy locally composable or callable-checkable.
- Inside a match or callable object expression, `ref(...)` may name a projected Class, Function, Policy, View,
  or Core node from the local Domain or an exact direct dependency. Referencing a dependency Policy this way
  compares or traverses its projected graph node; it does not evaluate that Policy.
- Method refs require a compatible SDK/DSL: `ref(methodHandle)` or `ref(() => methodHandle)` names an
  exact concrete declaring Method, static or instance. Abstract slots and inherited aliases are not
  Function projections; reference the executable declaration from the local or direct-dependency owner.
- Every normalized branch must use exactly one target mode. A Node-Policy branch references `object`; an
  Edge-Policy branch references `source`, `target`, or both. The `subject`, every referenced protected term,
  and every scoped existential variable must form one connected proof graph. A branch saying only “caller
  belongs to a group” is not resource-scoped and rejects.
- Query admission separately verifies the candidate's exact Edge Class, then evaluates its Policy against
  the admitted `source` and `target`. Constrain whichever endpoint owns access. A Policy Edge predicate is an
  existence test; do not use it as a surrogate identity check for the candidate Edge.

- Each `check(policy, object)` evaluates one Policy against one protected object. Checks on `self` and input
  refs are independent requirements, not a relationship between those objects; use callable `sameNode(...)`
  for exact Node equality.

## Composition consumes a budget

- Budgets apply after named-policy expansion and branch normalization, not per helper file.
  AND multiplies alternatives: `(A OR B OR C) AND (D OR E OR F)` creates 9 branches, over the current limit of 8.
- Current DSL limits include expanded pattern depth 4, 6 Edge-or-`sameNode` predicate leaves per normalized
  branch, 4 variables per `exists`, integral repetition bounds `0 <= min <= max <= 3`, and 4 distinct Domain
  origins including the Policy's own Domain. Callable checks also cap depth at 4 and leaves/branches at 8.
- Refactoring into named helpers does not reset those budgets. Simplify the actual proof topology
  when `PL_BUDGET` rejects; do not move authorization into a handler or drop an alternative to compile.
- These are Schema admission ceilings, not guaranteed runtime scan capacity. Verify the installed
  DSL's limits before relying on a boundary value; a bounded repeat is not unbounded group ancestry.

## Scope existential Node witnesses deliberately

- Policy Node selectors define authorization scope, not types. `node()` accepts any matching active concrete
  Node Class; `node(Class)` also accepts its active concrete descendants, including foreign ones;
  `node.exact(Class)` accepts only that exact concrete Class and is empty for an abstract Class.
- `node.exact(Class)` does not test Node identity; use `sameNode(...)`. Test every intentionally broad selector
  with an allowed witness and a connected unauthorized witness; include a descendant for polymorphic success.

## Policy and admission evidence

- Root success proves executability, not an application user's Policy. Test distinct registered principals
  with real business facts; a local CLI identity need not be registered or authorized on the target Kernel.
- Test credential failure, principal-profile denial, inherited Group capability success, and business
  Policy denial despite valid principal `can_use`. Keep Root/owner alternatives out of a test claiming Policy enforcement.
  For denials, prove reachable handlers, steps, Providers, and graph effects did not run; earlier Runtime
  initialization is outside that assertion.
- Inspect requested/materialized capabilities for Domain callers and live group composition for human
  callers. Prove the carried Grant independently, including relevant constraints, exclusions, and revocation.
- Keep evidence proportional: mutating denial needs an independent no-effect read, read-only denial does not.
  Test revocation by removing the business fact and repeating the same operation while the Domain stays installed.
