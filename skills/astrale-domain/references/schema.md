# Schema

Model the business world and its invariants, not a storage layout or anticipated UI. Every Class,
Edge, Policy, callable, View, and Core value has one semantic owner.

## Current language boundary

Kernel DSL V1 Domains expose Classes, Functions, Policies, Views, and Core data. Object definitions
belong to one Class hierarchy rather than parallel object-definition kinds. Domain code imports
language builders only from `@astrale-os/sdk/schema`; do not import Kernel DSL/Core directly or
recreate resolved Definition shapes.

## Classes

Use a node Class for an independently identifiable thing with properties and behavior. Use an edge
Class for a meaningful relationship between typed endpoints.

Shared object contracts use abstract Classes (`nodeClass({ abstract: true, ... })`), not a separate
interface declaration kind. Create concrete descendants, not instances of the abstract Class.

SDK-authored node Classes declare an icon: prefer `classIcon.lucide` with data from
`@astrale-os/sdk/schema/icons`, or `classIcon.svg` for custom SVG. `classIcon.neutral` explicitly shows
no glyph. Do not import React icons into Schema.

- Put a fact on a node when it describes that thing regardless of a relationship.
- Put a fact on an Edge when it describes the relationship: role, confidence, applicability,
  effective date, ordering, or coverage.
- Reify a relationship as a node only when it needs independent identity, lifecycle, permissions,
  provenance, or relationships of its own.

State endpoint direction and cardinality explicitly. Do not hide relationships in string IDs,
paths, generic JSON, or a catch-all relation Class. Do not add a constant business slug to a many-to-
many Edge merely to satisfy storage identity.

## Properties

Choose required versus optional from the business invariant, not fixture convenience. Reuse inherited
native node properties rather than redeclaring them. Preserve timestamps and identities through
SDK-owned canonical types.

One exported `stateMachine` is the authority for a finite lifecycle. Persist it with
`stateProperty(machine)` and reuse `machine.stateSchema` or `machine.eventSchema` in callable values;
do not copy its states or events into sibling enums or transition Rules.

```ts
import { classIcon, nodeClass, stateProperty } from '@astrale-os/sdk/schema'
import { CircleAlert } from '@astrale-os/sdk/schema/icons'
import { stateMachine } from '@astrale-os/sdk/state'

export const lifecycle = stateMachine({
  initial: 'open',
  transitions: { open: { close: 'closed' }, closed: {} },
})

export const Issue = nodeClass({
  icon: classIcon.lucide(CircleAlert),
  properties: { status: stateProperty(lifecycle) },
})
```

Mutable presentation text is not a stable identity. Node identity is canonical and opaque; serving
URLs and caller-assigned paths are not semantic node identifiers.

## Behavior ownership

- Group declarations under `schema/modules/<module>/`, with applicable `classes/`, `policies/`,
  `functions/`, `errors/`, `types/`, `states/`, `core/`, and `views/`. Do not manufacture empty directories.
- `classes/` includes node and edge Classes; `functions/` includes Methods and top-level Functions.
  Keep one declaration per file and curated facades; reserve root kinds for genuinely shared declarations.
- `types/` owns portable values, not Policies. Keep `policy: ({ check, self }) => check(mayEdit, self)`
  inline with its callable; reusable graph predicates belong in `policies/`.
- Infer composition types from authored values where possible, rather than maintaining an interface
  that repeats Schema fields. Do not cast away a genuine published-declaration or admission problem.

Put behavior on the Class whose invariant changes. A receiver-bound callable is appropriate when an
existing node is the subject of the change. Use a top-level callable for a Domain operation without a
receiver. Staticness belongs to Schema metadata; Runtime still implements the callable uniformly as an
Action or Workflow.

Abstract inheritance may share stable meaning between Classes, but do not create inheritance merely
for code reuse. Prefer composition and typed Edges when the relationship is not genuinely “is-a.”

## Policies

Schema Policy owns authorization predicates. Keep authentication mode, callable authority, and Policy
as distinct gates. Policy may refer to the authenticated subject, receiver, Core Groups, and graph
facts supported by the language. Do not move caller admission into Action/Workflow code.

`node(Class)` includes concrete descendants, including foreign installed descendants; it is not an
exact-Class check. Use `node.exact(Class)` to retain exact matching. Read `policies.md` for connected
proofs, direct-dependency references, and expanded-expression budgets.

## Core data

Use Core for stable Domain-owned reference facts needed immediately after installation, such as one
well-known Group. Do not use Core as demo data, mutable product state, a post-install hook, or a hidden
migration mechanism.

Reinstalling does not turn a Core declaration into an application-data migration. A projected Core
node keeps its ID only while its projected Path and Class stay unchanged; changing its Class can
allocate a new ID, so consumers should resolve the ref rather than cache an installation's ID forever.

## Views

Schema Views declare semantic view identities. Frontend routing and Shell handshake belong to the SDK
frontend composition, not to Class properties or callable handlers.
