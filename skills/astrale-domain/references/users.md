# Users and groups

Read when a Domain owns people who sign in, invites existing business users, or assigns group access.
Shell owns the shared User/Group contract; the business Domain owns its concrete users and their lifecycle.

## Prerequisites

Use compatible Shell and SDK packages, with Shell installed on the target instance. This guide uses
static `User.invite`, `Group.assignUser`/`unassignUser`, and registration of existing nodes. Check the
installed callable contracts before running examples; coordinate dependency upgrades using `migration.md`.

## One business user, three separate transitions

```text
create Employee extends Shell.User → same node, initially without Authentication
  ├─ invite through Shell → Admin registers the accepting user → assures Core member
  └─ register directly with user proof → explicitly assign the intended groups
```

- Extend `Shell.User` for a sign-in-capable business person; do not create a second Shell User beside
  Employee. Mere contacts need not become identities. Add business properties to the concrete subclass.
- Create through the Domain's ordinary Mutation, without `iss`/`sub`. Register attaches Authentication
  to that existing node; it does not create the person, change their profile, or assign a group.
- `displayName` and `email` are optional profile data, not authentication evidence. Editing an email
  does not change the bound identity; invitation destination is an explicit, separate argument.

## Allow Shell to traverse the membership endpoints

Shell maintains membership using its own authority. Grant `traverse` on each participating concrete
User and Group Class, not `read` of their profiles. An inaccessible endpoint must not look like absent membership.

This combined example represents separate Schema owner files; normal imports between owners are abbreviated.
It covers direct subclasses of Shell.User/Group, not arbitrary inheritance depth.

```ts
import { ShellSchema, S } from '@astrale-domains/shell'
import { K, KernelSchema, classIcon, defineSchema, nodeClass, policy } from '@astrale-os/sdk/schema'
import { UserRound, Users } from '@astrale-os/sdk/schema/icons'
import { z } from 'zod'

// schema/policies/shell-may-traverse-member.ts
export const shellMayTraverseMember = policy({
  description: 'Shell may traverse our direct User/Group subclasses to maintain membership.',
  match: ({ allOf, anyOf, sameNode, exists, object, ref, subject }) =>
    exists(({ node }) => {
      const concrete = node()
      const base = node()
      return allOf(
        { source: object, class: K.classes.instance_of.ref, target: concrete },
        { source: concrete, class: K.classes.extends.ref, target: base },
        { source: base, class: K.classes.of_domain.ref, target: subject },
        anyOf(sameNode(base, ref(S.classes.User.ref)), sameNode(base, ref(S.classes.Group.ref))),
      )
    }),
})

// schema/modules/employee/classes/employee.ts
export const Employee = nodeClass({
  icon: classIcon.lucide(UserRound),
  extends: [S.classes.User],
  properties: { employeeNumber: z.string().min(1) },
  policies: { traverse: shellMayTraverseMember },
})

// schema/modules/team/classes/team.ts
export const Team = nodeClass({
  icon: classIcon.lucide(Users),
  extends: [S.classes.Group],
  policies: { traverse: shellMayTraverseMember },
})

// schema/schema.ts
export const schema = defineSchema('work.example', {
  dependencies: { kernel: KernelSchema, shell: ShellSchema },
  classes: { Employee, Team },
  policies: { shellMayTraverseMember },
})
```

- The Policy identifies Shell through protected Schema ownership, not a configured Domain NodeId.
  Parent-Class Policies do not replace the concrete foreign Class's traversal agreement.
- Preserve existing traversal with `policy.anyOf(existingTraverse, shellMayTraverseMember)`; do not
  replace business access or broaden `read`/writes. Deeper inheritance needs an explicitly verified pattern.

## Invite or register, without substituting the identity

| Path | Consumer responsibility | Completion |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Invitation | Call static `Shell.User.invite({ user, email })` on the existing User | Admin binds the accepting identity and assures Core member |
| Direct Register | Submit valid self or external user proof for the existing node under authorized Domain/operator authority | Authentication only; group assignment is separate |

- Register needs real user proof valid for the target Kernel. Email, a freely supplied `(iss, sub)`,
  or an administrator's credential cannot replace it. Never pass private keys into a Function.
- Authentication is write-once and `(iss, sub)` is unique per Kernel. Do not self-register a node as
  a temporary step before WorkOS registration; that is not an interchangeable login binding.
- Preserve the same node and registration key on retry; do not create another person after an uncertain
  result. A new equivalent proof can refresh credentials without changing the intended identity.
- Invitation `accepted` is not final access: `completed` follows registration and member assignment.
  A normal login must not recreate revoked membership; invitation does not imply admin or Fleet access.

## Use Shell's group operations

- `Group.assignUser({ user, group })` maintains both `member_of_group` and Kernel `extends_with`;
  `unassignUser` removes both. Do not write just one Edge or implement a parallel membership system.
- The User-Class owner may invite its users and assign them to exact Core `member`; it cannot thereby
  assign Core `admin` or unassign Core `member`. The Group-Class owner may assign/unassign its own Teams.
- Core `admin` and `member` are independent groups, not an implicit hierarchy. Registration grants
  neither; an explicit admin assignment is privileged, not a default business onboarding step.
- A Team has no implicit capability profile. Membership may drive business Policies; installation
  profiles grant capabilities to local Core identities, not arbitrary dynamic groups or users.
- Unassigning removes that direct pair, not Authentication or every other access path. Memberships
  may precede registration; removing `member` alone is not a permanent ban on owner-authorized readmission.

Shell's three methods above are intentionally Policy-admitted. Do not add direct `can_use` requirements
for them: that bypasses their caller Policy. Declare Kernel Query/Mutate/Register capabilities only as
needed, and protect the business callable before it invokes Shell as the Domain. See `policies.md`.

## Inspect and exercise the installed surface

Use an already authorized operator; replace example IDs with returned IDs on the same instance.
These are static Shell methods, not `@user::invite` or instance Group methods.

```sh
astrale introspect /:shell.astrale.ai:class.User:invite -i staging --as operator
astrale introspect /:shell.astrale.ai:class.Group:assignUser -i staging --as operator
astrale call /:shell.astrale.ai:class.User:invite \
  user=@employee-id email=alice@example.com -i staging --as operator
astrale call /:shell.astrale.ai:class.Group:assignUser \
  user=@employee-id group=@team-id -i staging --as operator
```

These Shell handlers require exact `@NodeId` inputs; responses contain bare IDs. Resolve Core member/admin
on the target instance first, rather than sending group labels or IDs copied from another Kernel.

For local-key testing, use a CLI whose `astrale identity register --help` exposes `--node`.
Register the existing Employee ID; do not create another node to attach login credentials.

```sh
# Only with the existing-node registration CLI and an authorized operator.
astrale identity create alice
astrale identity register alice --node @employee-id -i staging --as operator
astrale get @self -i staging --as alice --json
```

If the operator lacks authority over Employee, use `--via` only with the Domain's explicitly admitted
registration Function. Do not add a public registration wrapper or a generic enrollment callback for invitation.

Verify the same User ID before/after activation, both membership edges, and a real allowed/refused
business call. Shell traversal must work without exposing private profile properties. Test root/bootstrap
separately; mocks and locally stored identities do not prove WorkOS acceptance or installed access.
